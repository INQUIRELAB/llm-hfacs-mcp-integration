      "text": "During vectors into OKC from the east, the Approach Controller assigned us Runway 17R differently from the one we had setup (17L). After re-configuring for the ILS 17R, I asked the Pilot Monitoring to brief the approach so I can concentrate on flying (Approximately 14,000 feet MSL and descending to 4,000 feet). During the brief a bright shining white light, like a spotlight shined at us, caught our attention and cause a distraction. We still conducted the briefing, including the highest elevation figure. As I kept flying I was paying attention if the light shined us again, in the event it was a laser that needed to be reported. I had the terrain page setup from the previous briefing and both pilots were aware of the obstacle northeast of the airport (Antenna 2758 feet MSL). After the briefing was complete, we were given a vector (a 90 degree angle) for the approach within a close proximity of the Final Approach Fix (minimum altitude at FAF 3,000 feet MSL). This vector would have flown us south of the obstacle depicted in the plan view section of the approach chart. Approximately 18NM from the airport the Approach Controller queried the visual contact of the airport. Pilot Monitoring told me he had contact with it and after I picked it up in sight I asked to call for it if he still had it. At that point the Approach Controller cleared us for the visual approach for [Runway] 17R. Slightly after, the Approach Controller notified us of traffic on the approach to the parallel runway. Both pilots were trying to ID the traffic since it was below our altitude and we had to cross his approach path. We seemed clear of the traffic, but a strong wind from the south was drifting us north which cause a concern for us due to the known obstacle. The aircraft was just approaching 4,000 feet of altitude and started to level off, when I set 3,000n in the Altitude Select box. The aircraft transitioned into a shallow descent instead of holding 4,000 since it wasn't fully captured. While having a discussion about the wind I adjusted my heading and kept the descent to 3,000 feet so we could be close to level and slow when we intercepted the course outside of the FAF. Around 3500 feet we both remembered the obstacles when we saw its lights ahead and below us. I already started a transition into a climb when the Pilot Monitoring verbally reminded me of the obstacles. During the climb we got a \"Caution Obstacle\", due to the projected descent, which was removed shortly since we were already compensating. We were 500 to 700 feet above the highest obstacle. The obstacle represented on the MFD was not the highest elevation figure on the IAP chart. This depicted obstacle was part of another group of towers not depicted on the chart but they can be seen on the VFR chart in the Jeppesen app. Since it was a visual approach, I had focused on maintaining the airport inside, and started to descend and slow down so we could be on a good position for the stable approach. Following the event, we landed with no issues and had a discussion at the gate on how we could have mitigated our error. We were below the MSA and had loss awareness of the obstacles due to other distractions and the tight vector to the approach with the visual approach. Several factors played key roles for the loss of situational awareness that led us to be at a lower altitude for our location. Flags: -A night Visual approach into an airport were an obstacle is a threat. -A night Visual approach to an airport were the elevation of the airport is higher than we are normally used to. -An arrival consisting of an extended base into a visual approach rather than a downwind arrival. -The change of runway that led to a new setup and briefing. -The distractions caused by the wind-drift, traffic, and the bright light. -The tight vector given and accepted for the original approach. Our error was the premature descent to 3000 feet with the goal of not being high once we intercept the final course with short distance to the final fix. Although the setup for the approach included the awareness of terrain and using the terrain displayed as an aid, we should have use TEM to establish a plan to avoid the premature descent. A briefed plan of using the last assigned altitude of 4,000 feet until intercepting would have avoided this. During the approach brief, I should have asked my Pilot Monitoring to intervene in the event I set a lower altitude while maneuvering for the visual (mitigation plan in the vent of losing SA). I realized that our briefings cover informational items that could be threats but we should discuss mitigating plans for them. Other actions that could have been taken are: 1) denying the visual at night due to the obstacle, 2) requesting a vector for the visual, and 3) querying if a lower altitude was needed which would have led the Controller to keep us at 4,000 feet."

    "Narrative: 2": {
      "text": "I was Pilot Monitoring. Approximately 20min out we were giving the option to change our landings intentions from [Runway] 17L to 17R which we took. Captain asked me if I could brief the approach which I did and then we performed the runway change items from the checklist. During this briefing moment we both noticed a bright light from about a 12 o'clock position which caught our attention. Captain was aware of the obstacles to the northeast of the airport (antennas) and turned on the terrain. At approximately 18 miles out we were asked if we had the airport in sight. We both saw it and were cleared for the visual approach Runway 17R. Winds were out of the south at approximately 26kt pushing us to the north since we were coming from the east. We were at 4,000 ft. and began a gradual descent. ATC advised us of traffic at 11 o'clock landing on the parallel runway. Looking for the traffic we began to noticed the red lights of the obstacles (towers) on the northeast of the airport. I pointed them out as [did] the Captain. The altitude window was set for 3,000 ft. we were currently at 3,400 ft. Captain turned off the autopilot and began a climb. As we were climbing we received a Caution for the obstacle but it cleared quickly since the Captain had already began the climb. Once cleared we continue to intercept the final approach course and perform a normal landing. We both had a long discussion after the flight and both agreed that we should had mitigated this by simply staying at 4,000ft when cleared for the visual approach since we knew about the MSA which is 3,800 ft. Also the parallel traffic played a role on this since we started looking for it due to it being in our path for intercepting the final approach course of [Runway] 17R. As a Pilot Monitoring I should had advised the Captain that selecting 3,000 ft. and continuing the descent once cleared for the visual would had put us close to the highest obstacle stated in the approach plate. I will keep this in consideration for future flights to come ensuring we are not at a lower altitude than the MSA not established on a final approach course as well as keeping in mind obstacles around us at all times."

We got an Obstacle Alert at approximately 3,300 ft, approximately 1-2 NM northeast of a tower group depicted on the approach plate. Approach Control called out the towers as the Captain initiated a climb of a couple hundred feet to increase the tower crossing clearance altitude. We could have coordinated and reviewed the approach plate and plan better prior to executing the cutoff of course to final. The towers in question were the highest obstacles on the approach. Additionally, the towers were very difficult to see at night because the lights blended into the city surrounding lights and at times appeared to be straight, lighted roads. A little better briefing and review would have prevented the alert. Aircraft systems worked flawlessly however, as well as ATC involvement helped to gain altitude to increase the altitude crossing safety margin. Fly the instrument approach plate as depicted to avoid any threats is a good idea."

      "text": "Normal flying of STAR to destination airport. Conducted the RNAV-Z in VMC conditions. Aircraft was stable at 1,000 feet AGL and on speed and glide path over the threshold. During landing, the tail of the aircraft contacted the ground as the aircraft settled and struts compressed. Touchdown was very soft and did not cause alert to either flight crew member. No abnormalities were detected by either flight crew member (tactile or audible). Neither Flight Attendant noted any abnormality during landing. Damage to a WiFi antenna, dump mast and an antenna occurred. The flight crew was unaware of the occurrence until two days later. Because the outbound crew was present upon arrival, we did not conduct a post-flight walk-around. We picked up the aircraft the same morning. During the first walk-around I noticed the right main strut seemed slightly lower than usual, though I didn't think it posed a threat. Aircraft have unique indications of wear and tear, and the strut varies greatly based on that and current weight on the aircraft. I did not indicate anything to the Captain as slight variances in aircraft are common. Takeoff at the departure airport was normal. No over-rotation occurred. During landing at the event airport, the touchdown was very soft and the ground spoilers did not immediately deploy. I was able to feel this, and I was also unable to initially deploy the thrust reversers. As the aircraft slowed, there was enough weight on wheels to deploy the ground spoilers and thrust reversers. As the aircraft settled onto the ground, I pulled back slightly to keep the nose wheel from slamming into the ground. Because of the slightly lower strut and the settling of the aircraft during the delayed spoiler deployment, I believe this to be when the tail of the aircraft contacted the ground. There were no audible indications and neither flight crew member felt anything abnormal. Possible guidance from Maintenance indicating how low of a strut is too low. This can be difficult as there is still a great bit of normal variance from aircraft to aircraft. Guidance for pilots regarding a technique to use during delayed spoiler deployment."

      "text": "We had a stabilized landing at OKC Runway 35L in VMC conditions with light winds. The landing was soft enough to delay ground spoiler deployment. When the spoilers did deploy the aircraft settled on the runway and possibly scraped the tail. The aircraft's pitch at touchdown was normal with no \"nose-up\" attitude. We do not know why an aircraft would scrap its tail on a perfectly flown landing. Contributing factors can only be guessed. They would include a delay in ground spoiler deployment due to WOW [Weight On Wheels] issues caused by an unusually soft landing and the possibilities of under-inflated struts. If a scraped tail was caused by a perfectly flown approach and landing, from a crew's perspective, I do not know how to avoid this from happening again."

      "text": "Cleared for the visual approach to Runway 17R into OKC and was handed over to OKC tower. We checked in and were cleared to land 17R. I heard tower communicating with another aircraft that I could not hear. After recognizing a military call sign and became aware that they were on a HF frequency. Tower was advising him to remain in traffic for 17L as there was \"traffic for 17R\". A few seconds later he was advising them of traffic again for 17R and that it was a \"Aircraft X\". At this point I was trying to identify this aircraft as it was appearing to get a little out of hand between the tower controller and the military aircraft in the pattern. I identified the aircraft on TCAS as being at our 1130 to 12 o'clock and 300 feet below us climbing. At this point we are on final by the marker and we are trying to visually see the target. I look back at TCAS and the aircraft is 100 feet below us climbing and at 12 o'clock in close proximity. We receive a TCAS advisory to \"descend. descend, descend now!\" We visually see this [military aircraft] coming at us and climbing but then leveling off at our altitude. I followed the RA as best I could as it appeared to be all red descending. It immediately then transitioned to a climbing command as we were closer to the ground than what was comfortable for a high rate of descent. We were in a Flaps 23 gear down configuration at this point. We were able to level off. [Military aircraft] remained at our 1 to 2 o'clock position and was communicating with tower but we could only hear towers instruction to him. Tower appeared to try and get him into the pattern again for 17L. We configured for landing and were in the configuration by 1000 feet and I think we were stable. We were stable for sure at 500 feet. [Military aircraft] remained at the 1 to 2 o'clock position and I was too focused on him and what he may do as he was still too close to us after this incident to be comfortable. I wanted to go-around to collect our thoughts as this incident was way too close \"for comfort\" but I did not trust the actions of the [military aircraft] pilot after this incident as he was paralleling our course towards the runway and was trying to get back into the pattern so I felt it was safer to continue and land and we were descending on glide path to the runway and he was maintaining altitude upwind for the 17 runways. In summary we had a near miss on final approach to runway 17R in OKC which caused a TCAS RA. It commanded a uncomfortable descending RA within about 1500' of the ground followed by a climbing correction. We followed the RA as we were trained. I was the flying pilot and the autopilot was off. The [military aircraft] was close that the RA required me to bring power to idle and push hard over to initiate the RA. At no time did the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) activate. We were stable on approach. We spoke with TRACON manager after landing and he advised that there were two military trainers in the pattern. There may have been some miscommunication between the aircraft and the tower controller. I made a PA at the gate advising the passengers of why the maneuvers on final and also the Flight Attendant heard very clearly the oral warnings as did some first class passengers. Appeared the military trainer entered final for our runway of 17R instead of 17L and when instructed to go around or re-enter the pattern he turned directly into our flight path and came directly at us."

      "text": "I was working Local Control. Aircraft X came over to my frequency cleared for a visual approach to Runway 17L. I cleared Aircraft X to land. Where Aircraft X turned base was 4 miles to the east of a satellite airport PWA. [The satellite airport] is allowed to launch VFR aircraft east bound climbing to 2,500 feet. This is directly into the final approach to OKC. When Aircraft Y data tag appeared east bound, the aircraft was flying directly at Aircraft X. I had just keyed up to clear another aircraft for takeoff when I noticed the traffic heading straight at Aircraft X. Instead of clearing the aircraft for takeoff, I called traffic for Aircraft X. Aircraft X had no idea that the traffic had just departed the satellite airport. If Aircraft X had not stopped at 3000 feet in the descent, Aircraft X could have descended into Aircraft Y. Additionally, if Aircraft Y does not comply with the 2,500 foot restriction he would have climbed into the Aircraft X. I believe the radar controller called the traffic for Aircraft Z and Aircraft Y did pass behind Aircraft X. Aircraft X to my knowledge did not have Aircraft Z in sight at any time. This is an unsafe operation. All VFR departures from this satellite airport should depart on headings between 200 and 360 (right turn outs). This will keep the aircraft away from the finals at OKC in a south flow. I also work radar as we are combined facility. There is a Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) approximately 7 miles east of the satellite airport that is 3,700 feet MSL. The Letter of Agreement with PWA allows eastbound departures to depart east remaining 6 miles north of OKC at or below 2,500 feet until 4 miles east of the airport. This puts VFR aircraft right next to the antenna farm with an MVA of 3,700 feet. While I realize the aircraft are VFR it is an uncomfortable position to be in as a radar controller if you have traffic above the VFR and you cannot let them climb as the aircraft is headed towards the antennas. This is also our downwind and that are multiple times that aircraft have to be kept low to avoid the aircraft. However, you cannot vector the aircraft because the aircraft if below the MVA which makes it even more difficult. If all VFR departures went to the west and north, when OKC is in a south flow, this would avoid the finals at OKC and the downwind while not imposing an undue delay to the VFR traffic departing. Another option would be for satellite airport to call for release for eastbound VFR aircraft."

Weather was MVFR with 2 miles visibility reporting with 400 scattered, 1200 scattered, 8000 overcast. It was almost night time. On about a 1 mile [final], Tower tells us to go around as the aircraft on the runway began its takeoff roll. We were over the runway at about 400 ft when we believe the instructions from the Tower told us to turn right. We said, \"say again.\" We believe Tower said \"[call sign] turn right.\" Not really understanding what the Tower wanted us to do, we ask, \"what do you want us to do?\" Then finally I believe another voice came over and said \"turn right to 050 and climb to 3000 feet.\" There was never any threat of a midair but the instructions from the Tower were initially not understood and of no help. A significant issue could have occurred if we would have continued runway heading with the aircraft taking off below us. One of the main issues of us getting into this situation was the inability of the pilot flying to slow our aircraft down, however we were never told that there was an aircraft on the runway preparing for takeoff, or the need to slow our aircraft down by the Tower because an aircraft was on the runway preparing for takeoff."

      "text": "We had to abort the initial start of the takeoff roll upon receiving a \"config Spoilers\" warning message. The aircraft had just began to move when we retarded the thrust levers back to idle. All 4 BTMS readings were showing 01 upon exiting the runway so no excessive braking was used. We notified ATC of our intentions & then exited the runway. We then informed both Flight Attendants & our passengers as to what had happened. After clearing the runway, we stopped the aircraft & set the parking brake so that we could run the appropriate checklists to address the issue. The spoilers were retracted to the detented position of \"0\" & then we proceeded to continue on with the flight as planned. Upon pushback, we received both an IDG1 & GEN 1 OFF caution messages. We notified Maintenance & were given instructions to defer the IDG. We completed the deferral paperwork & then awaited the new release from dispatch. While entering the performance data & conferring with our dispatcher in regards to our situation, the First Officer had pulled the flight spoiler lever back to have better access to the FMS keyboard. I had been entering the MEL & deferral information into the Maintenance log at that same time. We were then asked by ATC to move the aircraft to the southeast corner of the ramp so that [another] aircraft could have access to the taxiway. Once we repositioned the aircraft, we completed the remaining paperwork & performance data. As we were taxiing out to the runway, the First Officer noted that our fuel had dropped below the minimum for takeoff. He sent the dispatcher a message via ACARS & after a couple of minutes we were given an amended minimum fuel number which met our requirements for takeoff. Upon reaching the hold short line, ATC had ordered us to line up & wait, which we refused because we still had yet to complete the before takeoff check. ATC amended their instructions to now hold short of the runway & then cleared [another] flight to depart from the intersection behind us. We completed the checklist & were then given clearance to takeoff. I positioned the aircraft onto the runway & transferred the controls to the First Officer. He then proceeded to advance the thrust levers forward, which unfortunately due to the position of the flight spoiler lever, led to the configuration warning and the retarding of our thrust levers from takeoff to idle. The lesson I learned from this event was to assess exactly what is going on at all times, both inside & outside the cockpit environment. There were many factors involving not only maintenance, but with the communication between ATC & both pilots as well. I felt like the FO & I were concerned with getting the paperwork handled correctly & accommodating ATC's requests, that it completely slipped our minds to notice or catch that the flight spoiler lever was out of position. It was dark outside as well, which made it less obvious to us that it was not where it should have been. I believe in the future that if I have more than one situation arise at the same time, I will stop everything I'm doing so that I can re-evaluate every issue at hand. This should be helpful in order for me to prevent a snowball effect of things which could lead to something similar as to what happened with this event."

      "text": "I convinced my captain to fly the wrong SID out of OKC. I cleaned and restocked the aircraft.  When I returned to the plane, the captain had already picked up the clearance, and was finishing up setting up the cockpit. I read on the paper (handwritten) that we were given the THRPE1 THRPE TUS.... (Later I discovered this is where I made the error, we were assigned the TRUPR1.TRUPR TUS...). I had some difficulty reading his handwriting, and I simply had read it wrong.) I put the THRPE1 procedure into my [tablet] and saved it as the favorite (STAR).  We then completed the required checklists.  I think we must have used his [tablet] when we verified the route, as everything checked out between the [tablet] route and FMS (which we verified later was set up with the correct procedure.) After our taxi checklist, our SOP has the Pilot Flying verify the Initial Heading, Altitude and First Fix.  I made a small SOP error by telling him what I thought the heading and altitude was, vs waiting for him to say what he thought it was to and me to verify.  To be fair, I was convinced at this point we were flying the THRPE1, not the TRUPR1. I stated as part of the SOP, initial heading, altitude and fix that at 1,800 feet, we execute a right turn to 200.  He hesitated, and then looked down at my [tablet] to verify.  (My [tablet] was set on the wrong departure procedure however.). Because I showed him the plate (but the wrong one) he chose to believe the evidence I presented.  I had convinced him that there was a turn at 1,800 feet and departed with the turn to 200 degrees. A few seconds after we turned, Oklahoma [City] tower gave us a left turn back to 175 degrees.  I said something like (I guess tower forgot to tell us a nonstandard heading.). We both then noticed the FMS showed no turn.  He then asked me which procedure I was displaying on my [tablet], as his writing said TRUPR.  I looked again, and saw that it was TRUPR and not THRPE that I had thought I read. That is when we discovered I was showing him the wrong departure procedure.  A second after the 175 heading was issued, we were told to contact departure.  Departure never said anything about a deviation. The captain contacted the OKC control tower by telephone after we landed, I was told later by the captain that the person he talked to at the tower said that there was no deviation from us that they had heard about. In the future I will ensure that the [tablet] used by the non-flying pilot is the one used during the FMS cross check.  That would have lead to the discovery of the error. I should have waited for the Pilot in Command to give me his approaching the runway briefing (per the SOP), rather than give him mine first.  The SOP procedures are all new in this fleet (about a month I think, 3rd tour using them), over time errors in \"who says what\" will be corrected as we continue to use the new SOP. The previous flight has be conducted in a fairly hot cockpit.  I should have taken another 5 to 10 minutes in the air conditioned FBO, as before the last flight I had been waiting in a cockpit that would not cool below 90 degrees on the ground, and still stayed warm for the previous less than an hour flight.  Heat is fatiguing, which contributed to me reading his handwriting wrong. In this case the captain had obtained the clearance via PDC.  I should have asked (I didn't know what way he had obtained the clearance) and if the opportunity presents itself, confirm my [tablet] directly with the printed PDC message.  That would have limited the error. Either time anyone questions what they are being told by the other party, taxi the airplane to a safe position, tell ATC we need a few minutes, then resolve the problem without the distraction of taxing."

      "text": "We were issued the TRUPR1 departure, TRUPR, As Filed from Runway 17L. This departure was a vector SID of runway heading to 1,800 feet then heading 175 OR AS ASSIGNED. I obtained the clearance, programmed the box, and completed the configuration of the flight deck as the First Officer was busy with stocking and cleaning duties. Once he had joined me we briefed the flight per the new SOP and readied for departure. I stowed my EFB as his was designated the primary for the flight and we proceeded to start and taxi out. Nearing the runway he briefed initial HEADING, ALTITUDE, AND FIX per our new SOP however he had inadvertently selected the THRPE1 departure. This departure is very similar and immediately precedes the TRUPR1 when the SIDs are displayed on the EFB. This departure is also a vector SID of runway heading to 1,800 feet, HOWEVER YOU THEN TURN RIGHT TO A 200 HDG AT 1,800 feet. I looked over at his EFB to verify as I remembered briefing the 1,800 feet but not the 200 heading after. I saw the depiction that was displayed and unfortunately assumed that I had either forgotten or had just been mistaken. I then accepted the change not realizing it was incorrect. As we climbed through 1,800 feet. and began our turn the tower controller called and instructed us to fly a heading of 175. There was no other traffic, we were issued no other corrections and the flight continued normally. We reached cruise altitude and soon discovered our error. Upon landing I called the KOKC tower to discuss the departure but was assured there was no problem. I however, see this as an opportunity to share just how easy it is to make an error even when your departure is a runway heading vector SID. I could have avoided the confusion by setting the parking brake and confirming our differing interpretation of the action at 1,800 feet and comparing MY EFB to HIS EFB which I feel would have caught the error and solved the problem. I think the similarity in the names of the departures and procedure itself also allowed me to be more comfortable with my incorrect assumptions. This is an example of how important attention to detail is and being certain of your actions through a thorough and accurate brief. Thank you for your time."

      "text": "Upon contact with OKC Approach in day VFR conditions, we were subsequently vectored off the STAR for a visual approach to 17L at KOKC.  We had briefed a visual approach to this runway, backed up with the ILS.  I remember seeing KOKC on the left as we descended. Approach assigned us a heading of 340 and a descent to 4000 FT MSL and I verbalized that this would put us west of the field for a right base to 17L.  Subsequently Approach asked us if we had the field in sight, and we agreed. We were cleared the visual. I called for flaps and gear in sequence. The field we saw was off our right wing. We turned about an eight mile right base off the fix page for KOKC Runway 17L, with landing gear and Flaps 15, to finish configuring on final.  At 3000 FT MSL on base, Approach asked us if we were executing the visual to 17L at KOKC. We replied affirmative, and then Approach climbed us to 4000 FT MSL and subsequently vectored us north.  Approach told us we were headed for Tinker AFB (visually about seven or eight NM at our two to three o'clock). We recognized our mistake, and coordinated with Approach for vectors to the Localizer for 17L at KOKC. We should have turned a left base to 17L instead of a right turn. Once we were positively sure of our position relative to KOKC, we coordinated for the visual to 17L and landed uneventfully at KOKC. Upon discussion with the other Pilot after the flight, we both recalled from training the technique to fly to the final approach fix using the FMC for the intended visual approach.  Given the conditions of an older model aircraft without the plan view that helps distinguish between airports, day VFR, multiple large airports in the local vicinity, an approach from the south that arrived near two airports, and the expectation bias of seeing an airport and reacting to a perceived location while using just the FIX page, the technique to fly to the final approach fix before committing to a pure visual approach is a much better planning tool to maintain situational awareness. I will certainly employ this technique immediately, as well as brief the threat of multiple airports in the vicinity. Also I will verbalize our position as we fly the approach, to give the other Pilot multiple chances to verify our position.  The KOKC 10-7 page does warn about confusion between multiple airports in the vicinity, yet I did not do enough to guard against this threat.  I will employ better planning via a more detailed briefing and more attention to approach waypoints to reduce this threat."

      "text": "It was night, overcast at 300 feet, with winds from the northeast. ATC advised us to expect the ILS 35R in OKC. I was pilot flying and when I briefed the threats, I mentioned that one of the OKC runways has LED runway lights that are pretty bright and make it hard to actually see the pavement. The approach was stable by the FAF and we broke out as expected at about 300 feet. The runway lights must have been turned all the way up on high because of the weather conditions, and 35R was indeed the runway with LEDs, edge lights, centerline, and touchdown zone. It was so bright that I literally could not see the pavement when landing. The landing was not hard but it was flat as the result of a later than normal roundout, and I was flaring almost entirely off the callouts of the radar altimeter. The captain agreed with me after the fact and stated that it was like landing in a black hole with absolutely no depth perception. (I should say that I believe the lights are LED. In any case they seem to be a lot brighter than normal runway lights.) The cause of the event was simply being in a [Medium transport, low wing, 2 turbojet engines aircraft] where the cockpit is lower to the ground, with blindingly bright runway lights in our faces. Our landing lights did nothing illuminate the pavement in front of us, as it was completely washed out by the runway lights until we were 5-10 feet off the ground. I didn't see any notes on the 10-9 Jeppesen airport chart stating whether the runway had LED lights, although I'll check again later today. Now that I know which of the runways has those lights, I'll remember to ask the tower to turn the lights on medium or low next time. I can understand having super bright approach lights, but overly bright centerline and touchdown zone lights can make for an unsafe situation. As pilots we use the radar altimeter as a tool for aiding in the timing of the roundout, but I think we all still need some depth perception especially for the touchdown."

      "text": "We were cleared for and flew the new (three months old) OKC TRUPR1 RNav Departure off of OKC Runway 17L.  Although both of us have been to OKC many times, this new departure appears to be written so that it has a low altitude level off at 500 ft agl.  (In fact, there are numerous new OKC departures with this same altitude restriction on takeoff.)  As depicted, we thought the TRUPR1 requires a level off on takeoff at 1800 MSL, which is only 500 ft above field elevation.  We briefed in the chocks that it was a low altitude level off required but even then, I never actually realized it was only 500 feet above the field.  On takeoff, I passed through 1800 feet within a few seconds after liftoff.  The PIC, who was pilot monitoring, caught the error and I immediately corrected.  The aircraft went about 200 feet above the 1800 msl restriction at most so it was not technically an altitude deviation from an ATC standpoint.  However, due to the nature of this situation, I feel it is prudent to file this report so that our company, union, and the FAA can take a look at these OKC departures and do something about changing them, either procedurally, or to clarity it.   Since the aircraft was so low, the descent to correct to 1800 msl induced a GPWS warning that we were sinking on takeoff.   This altitude restriction, if it really is a hold down restriction, is a pilot deviation waiting to happen and is unsafe.  After reviewing the departure plate again for this report, however, I really am not sure how the procedure, as published, is expected to be flown because of the 1800 ft language for initial climb and the text on the Routing section, where it says to maintain 5,000 MSL.  I now suspect that it really means to climb to 5000 but to not turn until 1800 ft.  It certainly needs to be written and depicted better, if that is the case.  If that is not the case, and the 1800 ft is a climb and level off altitude, that needs to be change.  500 ft is to low for a jet to be leveling off for anything.  I strongly suggest a clarification be drafted and sent out to pilots, perhaps in the notams, at OKC. Certainly, after looking at this departure plate before departure, we should have seeked clarification from ATC before flying it.  However, my biggest concern is that if this really requires a level off at 1800 MSL, jet aircraft have no business whatsoever flying it and should be refusing to accept it.  It frustrates me that I am not really sure what this departure procedure really is, but then I only have over 40 years of IFR flying experience."

      "text": "While departing from OKC on the TRUPR1 departure, the captain (pilot monitoring) was performing his duties while following our previously briefed takeoff and departure, which included flying runway heading on the RNAV departure. As the captain checked in with departure, he swung the heading bug to a heading of 200 and informed ATC that we were climbing (stating leaving altitude climbing for published altitude) and in the turn to 200. I told him the departure was fly runway heading and went to correct, but by this time ATC had acknowledged our position and issued new instructions. She also inquired as to whether the heading of 200 was assigned in our clearance, to which the captain replied it was. As we turned to a new heading assigned by ATC, I insisted that there was a mistake and as we reviewed the chart he realized that just prior to takeoff, he had enlarged the plate on his ipad and had read only the textual content of the departure for a different airport sharing the TRUPR1. Unfortunately, this airport had a similar runway configuration and he reacted and contacted ATC so quickly, believing that we were doing what we should, that by the time the error was realized we had already checked in and been issued new ATC instructions. Clear communication: we had briefed the departure, but when the captain saw what he thought was a problem with the brief we should have discussed it rather than one pilot taking unilateral action Follow CFM: PM should tend to his duties and not assume control of the flight control panel while the PF has the aircraft. In both of these cases the captain, while mistaken, believed he was doing the proper procedure for the departure. Use Proper phraseology: we were cleared to \"climb via\" and on initial contact ATC was informed of our present altitude, our assigned altitude and our heading, rather than stating \"climbing via\". TRUPR1: this departure shares multiple airports on the same textual description. One of these airports has a similar runway configuration to OKC. Should a pilot take a quick glance on a takeoff (as what happened in this case) they may fly the improper departure procedure. Pilots should use caution when flying such a departure. Additionally, texts sharing multiple airports on the same departure can be its self confusing. Clear and specific departures should be considered for individual airports. Clarification on climb/descend via: it seems that such clearances might be better suited only in busy airspace with high traffic volume. Being issued a climb via clearance on a vectored (albeit RNAV) departure may be better understood with further clarification as to the intent of the clearance."

I looked at the Captain and we both agreed since it's a shorter taxi. I recall mentioning to the Captain that \"I guess they opened Runway 31,\" since it was reported closed on the ATIS. I accepted the offer and we were issued a taxi clearance to Runway 31. Once clear of the ramp, I pulled out the OPC to recalculate for the new runway. Shortly thereafter, at the runway, I switched to Tower frequency and we were cleared for takeoff for Runway 31. I don't know why the runway was listed closed on the ATIS, but it did not seem unusual to us that it was closed and then reopened by ATC. Furthermore, both Ground and Tower Control cleared us to the runway so we didn't question it. Finally, neither of us saw any markings to indicate that Runway 31 was closed. I feel that we both acted in a safe manner in this case. I don't recall seeing Runway 31 listed closed in any NOTAMs, and even if it was, I would assume that both controllers would be aware of their runway status. The next time, if there is any doubt, I will verify it with the controller."

I didn't recall seeing that but we both thought that the runway was open due to ATC offering it to us.

      "text": "We turned final for a planned full stop landing approximately 2 miles behind an Airbus A330. Tower advised \"caution wake turbulence\". We discussed and executed making steeper approach and landing long to avoid wake turbulence. The pilot flying intentionally added 10-15 KTS above normal approach speed as a precaution. The [Airbus] jet landed approximately 1,500 FT down the runway and we noted his \"smoke vortices\" from the tires touching down, and planned to land beyond them. Tower advised us to \"be prepared to go around\" and we agreed we would be ready. The [Airbus] turned off at Taxiway F while we were approximately 1,000 FT from the threshold at approximately 200 FT AGL. We elected to continue the landing as planned with the aim-point beyond the Airbus touchdown. While established on the extended Runway 17L centerline, heading 175, at approximately 150 FT AGL, our aircraft violently rolled into approximately 60 degree left bank, veered to an approximately 130 degree heading, started heavy buffet and sinking. Simultaneously, the pilot not flying pushed both throttles full forward and the pilot flying manipulated the flight controls as we attempted to execute a go-around. After rolling back to a wings level attitude but still buffeting and with a sink rate, the aircraft touched down on the grass heading 130. We touched down less than 3 seconds after initiating the go-around. A nearby security camera showed that we were 51 seconds behind the Airbus and that the wake turbulence upset occurred at approximately 100 FT AGL and on the same glide path as the Airbus. I can not explain why the glide path/touchdown aim-point picture we were seeing from our cockpit did not match reality as seen by the camera. I can only conclude that visually judging your glide path and touchdown point vs. that of an aircraft 2 miles in front of you is not as straight-forward/obvious as I believed it to be. I had been a USAF T-6 pilot training IP and the other pilot had been a USN T-34 pilot training IP. Both included extensive instructing of aerobatics and a wide assortment of unusual attitudes. Also, we had both attended an Upset Recovery Training course. I am firmly convinced that our backgrounds are the only reason we walked away from this event. Educate pilots that just visually de-conflicting your glide path/touchdown point from a preceding aircraft may not be giving you the safety margin you think it is, especially when close to the flare. Establish a minimum distance interval for landing behind \"heavy\" aircraft, especially when the winds are less than 10 knots. ATP candidates should be required to have an \"Upset Recovery Training\" endorsement similar to CFI candidates needing a \"Spin Training\" endorsement. Encourage pilots to execute a go-around anytime they even consider it and not wait until they actually see the need for it."

      "text": "While conducting multi-engine flight training with one engine shut down, flying eastbound in level flight at 4,500, my student and I received a traffic advisory from Oklahoma City Approach Control referencing a Gulfstream to our east, descending to 4,000. The student was practicing simulated instrument conditions with his outside visibility restricted and I was acting as safety pilot watching for traffic. I told the student that with existing visibility and ceilings it might be difficult to see traffic from that direction and instructed him to turn to the west, away from the potential traffic conflict. The Gulfstream traffic also received a traffic call referencing our position and after a few moments replied \"Seminole in sight.\" Due to our new westbound heading, traffic arriving into the terminal area from the east would have been obscured by our fuselage and not visible to us. About one minute later The Gulfstream appeared on our right approximately 2,000 horizontal feet north of us and descending through our altitude in a 30 degree bank from west to south turning towards our aircraft on what appeared to be a near collision course. The Gulfstream then appeared to increase its rate of descent allowing it to pass approximately 400 FT directly under our aircraft as if the Gulfstream crew had only seen our aircraft at the last moment. Due to the high speed of the Gulfstream and the sudden nature of the incident I did not have time to react before the Gulfstream had already passed beneath us. After passing beneath us the Gulfstream appeared to continue its descent to perhaps as low as 3,000 FT MSL as it recovered from the high rate of descent required to avoid us. I heard the Gulfstream crew advise the controller that they had descended to 3,500 to avoid traffic. It's not clear to me how the situation came to occur. I do not know if the Gulfstream was vectored into us or if the Gulfstream was providing its own navigation. After the incident I asked the Approach Controller \"Oke City Approach, [call sign] I thought that Gulfstream said they had us in sight\" and the Gulfstream crew replied \"Guess we got a real good look at you\". I understood the statement to mean they also thought we had gotten close. If the controller had advised the Gulfstream to stop above us or issued the Gulfstream a vector to avoid us the potential hazard would have been avoided. Also, the Gulfstream crew presumably lost visual contact with us and had they notified the controller of that fact he could have responded appropriately."

    "Narrative: 2": {
      "text": "While conducting single engine operations in simulated IMC during training for the Multi Engine Commercial rating we experienced a near miss with other traffic. While flying heading 090 at 4,500 FT MSL Approach called, \"(Tail number), Gulfstream traffic 12 o'clock, three miles, southbound, out of 5,000 FT to which I replied \"Searching, (last three of tail number)\". They then called the Gulfstream stating our position to which the crew responded, \"In sight\". After about 20 seconds I elected to make a 180 degree turn to the right to fly heading 270 because my instructor had not made visual contact with the traffic and we were not sure if the Gulfstream was VMC even though they had called us \"in sight\" based on estimated ceiling height above us. About a minute later while flying heading 270, assuming we had turned away from the traffic, my instructor showed extreme surprise and indicated that the Gulfstream had passed right to left \"just below us\" and had entered a dive shortly before reaching our lateral position causing a loss of separation/near miss, missing by an estimated 300 FT. I came out from under the hood, looked south, and saw the Gulfstream traffic below and (now) south leveling out from an apparent quick descent. My instructor called approach stating, \"Approach, (tail number), I thought that the Gulfstream traffic had us in sight\" to which approach replied, \"Affirmative\". The Gulfstream crew keyed up stating, \"Yeah, we got a real good look at ya\"! A few moments later approach called a B737 in our area requesting a report on cloud bases which were reported as 5,700 FT MSL. It is unclear how, after our turn to fly heading 270, the Gulfstream intercepted our flight path when it was originally reported as \"12 o'clock, three miles, southbound\" on our original heading of 090. I do not know for sure but contributing factors could be a flight crew's over reliance on TCAS painting targets without visually verifying traffic, traffic scanning procedures, and approach's work load causing them to miss a possible loss of separation despite the other crew calling us \"in sight\". Having a feathered right engine required our aircraft to need a five degree bank toward the running engine (left) causing our right wing to be further up in the air which possibly resulted in limited traffic scan ability to the right, level and below. Because the actual chain of events of all parties leading up to the near miss are not known no corrective actions can be recommended other than periodically dipping the wing of a failed engine to provide increased traffic scan ability to level and below during training/maneuvering flight."

      "text": "As a NE/SE RADAR Controller I was responsible for southeast, east, and northeast bound departures off OKC.  I noticed Air Carrier X \"tag up\" off the departure end of Runway 17L.  At the same time I noticed Aircraft Y 1 mile off the departure end of Runway 17R turning east bound.  Aircraft Y had a \"W\" in his scratch pad indicating they should be turning to a 260 heading.  The RADAR targets merged 1 mile south of Runway 17L at 3,000 FT MSL just as Air Carrier X called initially on frequency.  I immediately issued traffic as \"off your right\" as the targets were so close I couldn't give an accurate \"o'clock\" position.  Air Carrier X reported the traffic in sight  I issued a climb clearance to 15,000 FT and turn east bound.  Air Carrier X later asked if they had done something wrong.  The answer was negative.  Recommendation, attention to detail by the initial RADAR Controller who issued the climb out instructions would have alleviated the wrong scratch pad information.  The Local Controller should have been looking out the window to ensure all aircraft were on correct headings.  The Local Controller had the last opportunity to save the situation.  A quicker frequency change to Departure Control would have allowed the two controllers aware of the situation to rectify it prior to the dangerous proximity.  However, procedures dictate the Local Controller shall not switch the frequency of a departure until the departure \"tags up\" on the radar scope.  This procedure proved to be more of a detriment than an asset in this situation.  The Aircraft Y Controller and I both had to wait as the situation developed as we were not talking to either aircraft."

I NOTICED THAT THE FO DID NOT PUT A 30 MILE FIX AT 10000 FT AND 250 WHICH IS USUALLY CUSTOMARILY DONE FOR DECENT PURPOSES. I WAS POSTING TWO CHANGES IN MY COMMERCIAL CHART. THE FO WAS DISCUSSING PLACES TO LIVE WITH THE JUMPSEATER. THE FO BRIEFED THE VISUAL TO RWY 17R. AFTER SHE COMPLETED HER BRIEF SHE BEGAN TO PROGRAM THE FMC AND I COMPLETED THE DESCENT CHECKLIST. WHILE IN THE DESCENT I NOTICED THAT THE VNAV PATH HAD REVERTED TO SPEED OF 210 KTS. I THOUGHT THIS WAS DUE TO THE FO NOT PROGRAMMING THE FMC FOR A DESCENT ALTITUDE. I TOLD HER OF THE SPEED AND SHE BEGAN PROGRAMMING THE FMC AGAIN. THE SPEED BEGAN TO APPROACH 280 KTS. I COULD TELL THAT WE WERE HIGH ON PROFILE. AT SOME POINT ATC ASKED IF WE COULD GET DOWN FROM OUR ALTITUDE. WHILE PROCEEDING INTO OKC WE WERE GIVEN VECTORS TO INTERCEPT THE ILS RWY 17R. I LOOKED AT THE PROGRESS PAGE 2/3 AND SAW THAT WE WERE 16K OFF THE DESCENT PROFILE. WE WERE GIVEN VECTORS THROUGH THE ILS RWY 17R TO LOSE ALTITUDE. I RECOMMENDED THAT WE USE THE GEAR TO GET DOWN. THE FO REACHED FOR THE GEAR HANDLE AND WAS TRYING EXTEND THE GEAR WHILE SHE WAS THE FLYING PILOT AND AT A SPEED OF 285 KTS. I IMMEDIATELY TOLD HER NO THAT IT WAS MY JOB. SHE STATED THAT SHE MAKES THAT MISTAKE FROM HER OTHER JOB FLYING T-1'S FOR THE MIL. I DEPLOYED THE GEAR ON THE PROPER SPEED AND WE CONTINUED TO LOSE ALTITUDE. THE FO SLOWED TO 190 KTS AND BEGAN TO CALL FOR FLAPS AT THE CORRECT SPEEDS. I SUGGESTED THAT WE COULD TURN BACK TO THE AIRPORT NOW AND SHE AGREED. I TOLD ATC AND THEY GAVE US VECTORS BACK TO THE FIELD. I NOTICED THAT WE WERE BELOW GLIDESLOPE AND CONTINUING TO DESCEND. WHILE OVER DOWNTOWN OKC, I TOLD THE FO TO LEVEL OUT AND NOT TO DESCEND ANY MORE. I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY LOOKING FOR THE FIELD AND WATCHING THE FO FROM DESCENDING AND RUNNING THE CHECKLISTS AND TALKING TO ATC. DURING THIS TIME ATC CHANGED OUR RWY TO RWY 17L. I NOW HAD TO REPROGRAM THE FMC FOR THE CORRECT RWY AND RETUNE THE NAV AIDS. THE FO STATED THAT SHE HAD THE RWY BUT THE JUMPSEATER STATED THAT IT WAS TINKER AFB. WE CONTINUED ON OUR VECTOR AND SAW RWY 17L OKC AND LANDED."

SINCE WE HAD BEEN HELD UP FOR THE TFC, WE WERE SET UP FOR A VERY DEEP BASE (N OF DOWNTOWN). HE CALLED OUT TFC TO THE W WHICH WAS MOVING FROM W TO E, BUT IT AT LEAST 10 MI AWAY AND WE COULD NOT SEE IT VISUALLY OR ON TCAS. WE TURNED BASE AND BEGAN A DSCNT OUT OF 4000 FT. THIS PUT US HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH THE APCHING TFC. AS WE REACHED 3000 FT IN THE DSCNT IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THERE WOULD BE A CONFLICT. THE FO SAW THE ACFT VISUALLY. I COULD ONLY SEE THE TCAS TARGET. I BEGAN A CLB BECAUSE THE TCAS PRESENTATION INDICATED THAT OUR TRACKS AND ALTS WERE CONVERGING. SHORTLY AFTER I BEGAN THE CLB, THE TCAS ISSUED A CLB RA. THE FO RPTED THAT THE ACFT PASSED UNDER THE NOSE AND HE ESTIMATED 500 FT OF VERT SEPARATION. THE EVENT OCCURRED FOR 2 REASONS: 1) WE WERE ISSUED CLRNC FOR THE VISUAL APCH IN A SITUATION WHERE EXECUTING THE APCH WOULD CREATE A CONVERGING GEOMETRY WITH TFC THAT WE COULD NOT SEE. 2) THE CTLR DID NOT CONTINUE TO GIVE US TA'S TO HELP US FIND THE TFC OR TO ISSUE INSTRUCTIONS WHICH WOULD DE-CONFLICT THE SITUATION. EVASIVE ACTION INITIATED. APCH WAS CONTINUED WHEN CLR OF CONFLICT. SUGGESTIONS: ATC COULD HAVE CONTINUED TO CTL US RATHER THAT TURN US LOOSE ON A VISUAL WHEN HE WAS AWARE OF A TARGET TRACK THAT WOULD ENTER OUR APCH PATTERN. HAVING CLRED US FOR THE APCH, HE COULD HAVE CONTINUED TO ISSUE TA'S TO HELP US ACQUIRE THE TFC.

THE TUG AND CARTS FULLY ENTERED THE ZONE IN FRONT OF THE TAXIING ACFT AND THEN EXITED TO THE R TOWARD GATE. HE WAS DRIVING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPD AND MISSED STRIKING ME BY ABOUT 3 FT. HE APCHED THE SAFETY ZONE FROM THE TERMINAL, THAT IS FROM MY BACK, SO I DID NOT SEE HIM UNTIL HE WENT BY ME AND ENTERED THE ZONE. WHEN THE ARRIVING ACFT WAS STOPPED, I WENT OVER TO THE ACFT AT GATE TO SPEAK WITH HIM BY NAME. I ASKED HIM WHAT HE'D BEEN THINKING AND WHY HE'D ENTERED THE ZONE WHEN THE ACFT WAS ENTERING. HE TOLD ME HE HAD TO ENTER THE ZONE TO AVOID HITTING ME BECAUSE I'D STEPPED TO THE R. I TOLD HIM THAT THAT WAS NO REASON TO ENTER THE ZONE AND THAT HE HAD BEEN TRAVELING MUCH TOO FAST. HE SAID HE HAD TO GET THERE BECAUSE HE NEEDED TO HELP HIS FELLOW RAMPER UNLOAD THE ACFT PARKED AT GATE. HE MAINTAINED THAT HE'D DONE NOTHING WRONG. THERE WAS NO COMPELLING REASON FOR THIS EMPLOYEE TO VIOLATE COMPANY PROCS, ENDANGER OTHER COMPANY PERSONNEL, AND TO POSSIBLY HARM COMPANY EQUIP. BY WAITING LESS THAN 1 MIN, THE INBOUND ACFT WOULD HAVE BEEN PARKED, I WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE WAY AND THIS MAN COULD HAVE ENTERED THE SAFETY ZONE AND CONTINUED HIS WORK WITHOUT INCIDENT. INSTEAD, HE DISPLAYED A RECKLESS, WILLFUL DISREGARD FOR COMPANY ESTABLISHED PROCS, A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS, AND A DISREGARD FOR COMPANY EQUIP. WHATEVER FEW SECONDS HE MAY HAVE SAVED BY ENTERING THE SAFETY ZONE WERE NOT WORTH PUTTING THE LIVES OF OTHERS AND THE ACFT AT RISK. WHEN I RETURNED TO THE JETWAY, THE CAPT OF THE INBOUND ACFT APCHED ME AND SAID HE WAS GLAD HE'D SEEN ME GO TO SPEAK TO THIS EMPLOYEE. HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO IF I HADN'T. A FUELER WHO'D BEEN WORKING NEARBY ALSO CAME TO ME IN THE JETWAY AND SAID HE'D SEEN WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HE SAID, 'YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AROUND HERE OR THEY WILL RUN OVER YOU.' BASED ON HIS BEHAVIOR IN THIS INCIDENT AND HIS ATTITUDE, I BELIEVE IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THIS EMPLOYEE INJURES SOMEONE AND/OR SEVERELY DAMAGES SOME EQUIP."

THERE WERE SEVERAL ACFT ON THE TWR FREQ. JUST PRIOR TO TURNING R FROM TXWY E TO TXWY G, BOTH PLTS LOOKED BOTH WAYS FOR CONFLICTING GND TFC. AS I LOOKED L, I NOTICED SOME LIGHTS IN THE SKY, POINTED IN OUR DIRECTION, AT SOME UNDERMINED DISTANCE. THE LIGHTS WERE CLRLY LNDG LIGHTS AND THE ACFT WAS POINTED AT US, BUT THE DISTANCE COULD HAVE BEEN UP TO 10 MI. THE LIGHTS WERE NOT PERCEPTIBLY MOVING. WE MADE THE TURN FROM TXWY E TO TXWY G. AS WE PASSED TXWY K, I LOOKED UP FROM THE TAXI CHART TO SEE THE WHITE TAIL LIGHTS OF AN ACFT IN FRONT OF US, ALOFT, BUT VERY CLOSE TO THE GND. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE CAPT SAID 'OH MY GOD.' IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLR TO BOTH OF US THAT WE HAD BEEN OVERFLOWN AT AN EXTREMELY LOW ALT BY ANOTHER ACFT. THE OVERFLYING ACFT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 50-100 FT AGL, AND DID NOT CLB. 2-4 SECONDS LATER, THE CTLR, IN A RELAXED VOICE, SAID 'TWIN COMMANDER, YOU DO NOT APPEAR TO BE LINED UP WITH THE RWY, GO AROUND.' THE LOW FLYING ACFT, NOW IDENTED AS TWIN COMMANDER, MADE NO IMMEDIATE EFFORT TO CLB, AND IN FACT FROM MY VANTAGE POINT, THE TWIN COMMANDER APPEARED TO DSND SLIGHTLY. I BELIEVED THAT THE TWIN COMMANDER WAS HEADED FOR THE GND AND WOULD CRASH. WE MOMENTARILY STOPPED OUR TAXI, THEN CONTINUED WITHOUT INCIDENT. A NUMBER OF SECONDS LATER, THE TWIN COMMANDER STARTED A SLOW CLB. ABOUT 10 SECONDS AFTER THE TWIN COMMANDER EXECUTED THE GAR, THE TWR TOLD THE TWIN COMMANDER TO 'TURN L FOR A L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 35L.

FLT WAS IN LEVEL CRUISE WITH AUTOPLT ENGAGED. WE HAD BEEN LEVEL FOR ABOUT 1 HR. I REACHED INTO MY CHART BAG (BELOW AND TO MY L), THEN, UPON SITTING UPRIGHT AGAIN, I NOTICED A FLASHING AMBER LIGHT THAT INDICATES WE WERE OFF OUR ASSIGNED ALT. THE FLT GUIDANCE NO LONGER INDICATED ALT HOLD BUT, INSTEAD, VERT SPD. BECAUSE I WAS SO SLEEPY, THE EXACT PROB (ABOVE OR BELOW CORRECT ALT) DIDN'T REGISTER. MY EYES SAW THE INSTS BUT THE BRAIN WASN'T INTERPRETING. I MOVED THE VERT SPD CTL AND BROUGHT US BACK TO FL310 AND OBSERVED ALT HOLD ONCE AGAIN. SOME POINTS OF INTEREST ARE: 1) I LOOKED OVER AT THE FO AND NOTED HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP. 2) I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THE AUTOPLT DID THIS ON ITS OWN OR WHETHER THE FO BUMPED THE VERT SPD CTL (MAYBE TO CORRECT OFF ALT BY 50 FT OR SO) AND THEN FELL ASLEEP. I'LL NEVER KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED. WE GOT UP NEAR FL320 BEFORE THE TREND WAS REVERSED. ATC ASKED US TO 'SAY ALT' APPROX 4 MINS AFTER RETURNING TO FL310. I RESPONDED 'FL310' AND HE REPLIED, 'ROGER.'
